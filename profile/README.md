# Welcome to the Kinera Network GitHub Repository

## Overview

Kinera aims to revolutionize the media landscape by establishing a network of peer-to-peer relationships that span production, ownership, distribution, and curation, while providing tools to support these processes. In this proposal, we introduce the Kinera network to the Polkadot/Kusama communities, whom we invite to test and vote to facilitate rapid project growth up to the point of crowdfunding.

## Repositories

### [kinera-node](https://github.com/K1NERA/kinera-node)
This repository stores the pallets used in the Kinera node. It includes all the essential components needed to run a node on the Kinera Network, ensuring seamless operation and integration with our parachain infrastructure.

### [kinera-bot](https://github.com/K1NERA/kinera-bot)
A bot designed to map network events, providing real-time insights and automated responses to ensure the stability and security of the Kinera Network.

### [kinera-pallets](https://github.com/K1NERA/kinera-pallets)
This repository contains the pallets used in the Kinera Network parachain/node. These pallets include various modules for handling different functionalities, from asset management to governance.

### [kinera-template](https://github.com/K1NERA/kinera-template)
The Kinera Template repository offers a starting point for developers looking to create new pallets or nodes. It includes a basic structure and essential configurations to streamline the development process.

### [base-parachain](https://github.com/K1NERA/base-parachain)
A foundational repository for developing and deploying parachains within the Kinera Network. It provides the necessary tools and configurations to kickstart parachain projects.

### [zombienet-sdk](https://github.com/K1NERA/zombienet-sdk)
Forked from the paritytech/zombienet-sdk, this repository includes tools and libraries for interacting with ZombieNet, a testing framework for Substrate-based networks.

## Technologies and Frameworks

### Substrate
Substrate is a modular framework for building blockchains. It allows for high levels of customization and scalability, making it an ideal choice for the Kinera Network. With Substrate, we can implement advanced features and ensure our network remains at the forefront of blockchain technology.

### Polkadot
Polkadot is a multi-chain network that facilitates the interoperability of different blockchains. By integrating with Polkadot, the Kinera Network benefits from enhanced security, scalability, and cross-chain functionality. This integration allows us to leverage a broader ecosystem, ensuring our network remains secure and efficient.
